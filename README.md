# CivicActions Accessibility Requirements Tool
This is both a rough "clone" and several experiments based on [GSA's Accessible Requirements Tool (ART)](https://www.section508.gov/art/). 

- A simplified version of [Section508.gov's ART Tool](procurement_form.html), more or less.
- An evolving vision of [what I am suggesting for the USA](procurement_form_enhanced.html)
- A vision for EN 301 549 [an early conversion for European Union (EU)](procurement_form_en301549.html)
- A multi-lingual vision for EN 301 549 [what I am suggesting for the EU / Canada](procurement_form_en301549_i18n.html)
